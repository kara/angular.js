@ngdoc error
@name $compile:invalidmulti
@fullName Invalid multi transclusion.
@description

When using a directive that allows multiple transclusion points (e.g. the `transclude` property is set to `multi` in the directive definition), each transcluded element needs to match an `ng-transclude-select` selector in the directive template. Otherwise, it won't be properly appended to the DOM.  

This error occurs when the element does not match `ng-transclude-select` selectors in the directive template.
